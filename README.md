- [x] Try some more orthogonal orbitals and plot the FCI wavefunction
- [x] For each orbital set, calculate the Shannon entropy of the CI wavefunction
    defined as $H(|c_i|)$ = -\sum_i |c_i|log(|c_i); and plot them as a function of the orbitals used
- [x] Are the FCI energies in different orbitals the same?

- [ ] Study the dissociation of the H2O molecule using different orbitals and plot the relation between distance and entropies of different orbitals (HF, NO, various localized orbitals)
- [ ] Plot the total FCI energy wrt to bond lengths
